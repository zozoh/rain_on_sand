The Solipsist
=====

> *Fredirc Brown* was perhaps best known in America for his mystery and science-fiction tales. But he also wrote oddly amusing and thought-provoking tales like this one. The Second sentence of this brief fable is a pretty good dictionary definition of a ‘solipsist’.

Walter B.Jehovah, for whose name I make no apology since it really was his name, had been a solipsist all his life.A solipsist, in case you don’t happen to know the word, is one who believes that he himeself is the only thing that really exists, that other perple and the universe in general exist only in his imagination, and that if he quit imagining them they would cease to exist.

One day Walter B.Jehovah became a practising solipsist. Within a week his wife had run away with another man, he’d lost his job as a shipping clerk and he had broken his leg chasing a black cat to keep it from crossing his path.
He decided, in his bed at the hospital, to end it all.

Looking out the window, staring up at the stars, he wished them out of existence, and they weren’t there any more. Then he wished all other perople out of existence and the hospital became strangely quiet even for a hospital. Next, the world, and he found himself suspended in a void. He got rid of his body quite as easily and then took the final step of willing heimself out of existence.

Nothing happened.

Strange, he thougth, can there be a limit to solipsisit?

“Yes.” A voice said.

“Who are you?” Walter B. Jehovah asked.

“I am the one who crate the universe which you have just willed out of existence. And now that you have taken my place-’ There was a deep sigh ‘- I can finally cease my own existence, find oblivion, and let you take over.”

“But – how can I cease to exist? That’s what I’m trying to do, you know.”

“yes, I know,” said the void.”you must do it the same way I did. Create a univere. Wait until somebody in it really believes what you believe and will it out of exstence. Then you can retire and let him take over. Good-bye now.”

And the voice was gone.

Walter B. Jehovah was alone in the void and ther was only one thing he could do. He created the heaven and the earth.

It took him seven days.
