Let me tell you of the worlds I've left behind.

Earth you know; everyone knows it. 
It's the birthplace of humanity, although at this point not many consider it 
our "home" planet --- Phoenix has had that job since the Colonial Union was
created and become the guiding force for expanding and protecting our race in
the universe. But you never forget where you come from.
